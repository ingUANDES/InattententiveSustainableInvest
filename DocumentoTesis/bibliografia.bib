	abstract = {Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria are now considered significant, global non-financial evaluating factors of corporate value. However, no attention is given to what influences the integration of ESG information by individual investors in their investment decisions. This study first identifies different types of information investors use to make investment decisions. Risks identified in information integration in investment decision making is reviewed. Next, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model is used to identify individual investors’ investment tendencies and the factors affecting integration of ESG information into investment decisions. Each of four categories for UTAUT innovation adoption factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, and facilitating conditions) are discussed in relation to how they affect individual investors’ integration of ESG information. Standardization of ESG reporting and evaluation frameworks would reduce efforts to adopt ESG information and could build a strong foundation for facilitating ESG information integration. Corporates’ efforts to further communicate their ESG management through their investor relations and active governmental well as non-governmental organizations’ participation are recommended.},

	abstract = {We present a set of power investment models, the class of risky capacity equilibrium problems, reflecting different assumptions of perfect and imperfect markets. The models are structured in a unified stochastic Nash game framework. Each model is the concatenation of a model of the short-term market operations (perfect competition or Cournot), with a long-term model of investment behavior (risk neutral and risk averse behavior under different assumptions of risk trading). The models can all be formulated as complementarity problems, some of them having an optimization equivalent. We prove existence of solutions and report numerical results to illustrate the relevance of market imperfections on welfare and investment behavior. The models are constructed and discussed as two stage problems but we show that the extension to multistage is achieved by a change of notation and a standard assumption on multistage risk functions. We also treat a large multistage industrial model to illustrate the computational feasibility of the approach.},

	abstract = {In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered.  George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum published by the United States Air Force in early 1948. \textit{Linear Programming and Extensions} provides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems.  Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.},

	title = {Complementarity {Modeling} in {Energy} {Markets}},
	isbn = {978-1-4419-6123-5},
	abstract = {Summary: This addition to the ISOR series introduces complementarity models in a straightforward and approachable manner and uses them to carry out an in-depth analysis of energy markets, including formulation issues and solution techniques. In a nutshell, complementarity models generalize: a. optimization problems via their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions b. non-cooperative games in which each player may be solving a separate but related optimization problem with potentially overall system constraints (e.g., market-clearing conditions) c. economic and engineering problems that aren't specifically derived from optimization problems (e.g., spatial price equilibria) d. problems in which both primal and dual variables (prices) appear in the original formulation (e.g., The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) or its precursor, PIES). As such, complementarity models are a very general and flexible modeling format. A natural question is why concentrate on energy markets for this complementarity approach? As it turns out, energy or other markets that have game theoretic aspects are best modeled by complementarity problems. The reason is that the traditional perfect competition approach no longer applies due to deregulation and restructuring of these markets and thus the corresponding optimization problems may no longer hold. Also, in some instances it is important in the original model formulation to involve both primal variables (e.g., production) as well as dual variables (e.g., market prices) for public and private sector energy planning. Traditional optimization problems can not directly handle this mixing of primal and dual variables but complementarity models can and this makes them all that more effective for decision-makers.

We first explicitly derive optimal consumption and portfolio rules under RI and then show that introducing RI reduces the optimal share of savings invested in the risky asset because inattentive investors face greater long-run consumption risk. We also show that the investment horizon matters for portfolio allocation in the presence of RI, even if investment opportunities are constant and the utility function of investors is constant relative risk aversion. Second, after aggregating across investors, we show that introducing RI can better explain the observed joint dynamics of aggregate consumption and the equity return. Finally, we show that RI increases the implied equity premium because investors under RI face greater long-run consumption risk and thus require higher compensation in equilibrium.},

From a practitioner perspective, we bring together this information to explore different models and processes to assist in achieving optimal execution of trading strategies. After providing a taxonomy of trading costs, we discuss how these costs, particularly market impact costs, are estimated and forecasted. Proposed models for optimal execution designed to get the best execution of a single trade, or sometimes a sequence of trades, are reviewed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Despite the rising use of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings, there is substantial disagreement across rating agencies regarding what rating to give to individual firms. As what drives this disagreement is unclear, we examine whether a firm's ESG disclosure helps explain some of this disagreement. We predict and find that greater ESG disclosure actually leads to greater ESG rating disagreement. These findings hold using firm fixed effects and using a difference-in-differences design with mandatory ESG disclosure shocks. We also find that raters disagree more about ESG outcome metrics than input metrics (policies), and that disclosure appears to amplify disagreement more for outcomes. Last, we examine consequences of ESG disagreement and find that greater ESG disagreement is associated with higher return volatility, larger absolute price movements, and a lower likelihood of issuing external financing. Overall, our findings highlight that ESG disclosure generally exacerbates ESG rating disagreement rather than resolves it.

Such impact requires that the SR fund's mandate permits the fund to trade off reduced financial performance against reductions in social costs - relative to the counterfactual in which the fund does not invest in a given firm. Based on such an impact mandate, we derive a micro-founded investment criterion, the social profitability index (SPI), which characterizes the optimal ranking of impact investments when SR capital is scarce. If firms face binding financial constraints, the optimal way to achieve impact is by enabling a scale increase for clean production. In this case, SR and profit-seeking capital are complementary: Surplus is higher when both investor types are present.},

We model CSR as an investment to increase product differentiation that allows firms to benefit from higher profit margins. The model predicts that CSR decreases systematic risk and increases firm value and that these effects are stronger for firms with high product differentiation. We find supporting evidence for our predictions. We address a potential endogeneity problem by instrumenting CSR using data on the political affiliation of the firm’s home state.

The results are robust to controls for firm characteristics, different weighting methodologies, and the removal of outliers. The Best Companies also exhibited significantly more positive earnings surprises and announcement returns. These findings have three main implications. First, consistent with human capital-centered theories of the firm, employee satisfaction is positively correlated with shareholder returns and need not represent managerial slack. Second, the stock market does not fully value intangibles, even when independently verified by a highly public survey on large firms. Third, certain socially responsible investing (SRI) screens may improve investment returns.},

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns.},

While the DEA and SFA rankings are statistically correlated, overhead ratio rankings are negatively correlated with both SFA and DEA rankings.

The negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is shown to be stronger for firms that have greater investment discretion, i.e., firms with higher cash flows and lower debt ratios, and is shown to be significant only in time periods when hostile takeovers were less prevalent. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that investors tend to underreact to the empire building implications of increased investment expenditures. Although firms that increase capital investments tend to have high past returns and often issue equity, the negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is independent of the previously documented long-term return reversal and secondary equity issue anomalies.},

This paper constructs a sentiment index based on ESG news to measure public opinion of listed firms. First, there is a significant negative relationship between ESG news sentiment and stock price crash risk, indicating that higher ESG news sentiment can reduce the crash risk. Second, heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that ESG sentiment has a greater impact on crash risk reduction for firms with lower analyst coverage, lower information transparency, voluntary ESG information disclosure and non-state-owned. In addition, mechanism tests indicate that ESG sentiment affects stock price crash risk by reducing negative ESG incidents, information asymmetry, and agency costs. This paper examines the research inference that ESG news sentiment is beneficial in reducing stock price crash risk and expands the research on the governance mechanism of stock price crash risk.},

The empirical analysis uses data from a unique sample of the California electricity industry for which we observe the actual marginal cost and estimate the marginal cost from these data. We compare the actual values of marginal cost with the estimates from semiparametric and nonparametric methods, as well as with the estimates obtained through conventional parametric methods. We show that the semiparametric and nonparametric methods produce marginal cost estimates that very closely approximate the actual. In contrast, the results from conventional parametric methods are significantly biased and provide invalid inference.},

The results are robust to a series of robustness checks, including propensity score matching, Heckman two-stage estimation, staggered difference-in-differences (DID), placebo test, firm and year fixed effects and alternative proxies. The effect of ESG ratings on analysts' forecast accuracy is more pronounced for firms audited by accounting firms with low industry expertise and for firms tracked by analysts with low industry expertise. This paper responds to the calls for more research on ESG ratings and analysts' earnings forecast accuracy and provides implications that ESG assurance can effectively improve the quality of nonfinancial information of a company.

The purpose of this study is to examine size effects in sport clubs using data from two nationwide online surveys in Germany (n = 19,345) and Switzerland (n = 6,098). The results support the existence of economies of scope, since costs decrease with increasing number of different sports (not codes) offered in the same club. Yet, clubs only benefit from reduced costs until some point supporting club theory. Organizational size has a significant effect on various organizational problems. The findings have implications for the management of sport clubs and for policy makers.},

Corporate ESG performance mitigates stock price crash risk by boosting green investor attention, improving analyst competency, and reining management behavior. The effect of ESG performance on stock price crash risk is more significant when the city where the firm is located pays less attention to environmental protection and the large degree of marketization.

Esta tardía aparición de los fondos se justifica por el escaso desarrollo del mercado de capitales y la ausencia de una legislación específica. No obstante, posteriormente, viviría un buen momento lo que supuso su consolidación en el sistema financiero español. 
En el presente trabajo se pretende abarcar la evolución de la inversión colectiva tomando como referencia las variables más significativas de estos fondos, el número de fondos, el patrimonio y el número de partícipes a lo largo de sus distintas etapas.},

Our results indicate that a firms Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profile significantly affects valuation: an improvement of a firms CSR leads to a higher ratio of actual to true firm value. Analyzing the relation between ESG and misvaluation separately, we find that ESG expands existing overvaluation whereas it reduces undervalued firms’ deviation from the true value. We argue that both valuation effects are attributable to the worldwide trend of sustainable investing. Further analyses reveal a moderating role of market sentiment towards sustainability in the ESG-misvaluation relationship. Our findings suggest that firms CSR is indeed perceived as valuable by shareholders and supports stakeholder theorys view in considering CSR as beneficial.},

This study asks how different ESG scores are from traditional agency credit ratings. Are E, S, and G scores correlated? Most importantly, can ESG scores enhance the investment process? Can an active, ESG-tilted corporate bond portfolio strategy generate superior performance versus a relevant benchmark that does not explicitly take ESG scores into account? The authors conclude that ESG scores can be used to enhance portfolio outcomes via lower drawdowns, reduced portfolio volatility, and, in some cases, even marginally increased risk-adjusted returns. Their backtesting suggests that E, S, and G scores are not related to one another and that ESG scores are additive to traditional credit ratings; the contingent liabilities related to ESG issues are not necessarily factored into rating agencies’ assigned credit ratings.

Employing the standard deviation of ESG ratings from six major providers as a proxy for ESG uncertainty, we provide supporting evidence for the model predictions.

	abstract = {Purpose Existing empirical evidence on the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration on momentum portfolios is limited. The combination of the two is relevant given the risk-mitigating effect of ESG criteria, as well as the existence of momentum crashes. As such, ESG might lend itself to reduce crash risk for momentum investors. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors provide insight into the impact of an ESG-constrained investment universe on momentum returns. The overall investment universe is split into high and low ESG-rated segments to anylse the characteristics of momentum portfolios conditional on the ESG rating. Findings The authors document the existence of a momentum premium across European stocks and for a subset of high and lows ESG-rated stocks. However, absolute returns of momentum strategies are significantly lower if momentum strategies are pursued on a subset of high ESG stocks. Additionally, findings document a risk-mitigation effect of ESG for momentum portfolios with significantly lower returns for momentum portfolios based on low ESG stocks during periods of momentum crashes. Originality/value Research on momentum investing and the momentum premium is large and well established, yet many questions remain. A recent study by Daniel and Moskowitz (2016) has analyzed crash risk for momentum investors and identified periods of strong momentum crashes. On the other hand, the literature on ESG integration in standing investment approaches is still limited, but as demand for sustainable products is increasing, so is the demand for a better understanding of the impact of ESG integration. Consequently, the authors provide evidence on the benefits of ESG integration for momentum investors to reduce their exposure to momentum crash risk.},

	abstract = {Responsible investors require data to underpin their stock and sector selections. Regardless of the rating agency, bond ratings for a particular issuer are broadly similar. This is not the case for ESG ratings. Companies with a high score from one rater often receive a middling or low score from another rater. This article examines the extent of, and reasons for, disagreement among the leading suppliers of ESG ratings. The weightings given to each pillar of an ESG rating also vary across agencies. Many asset managers contend that ESG ratings can help investors to select assets with superior financial prospects, and the authors therefore review the investment performance of portfolios and of indexes screened for their ESG credentials. In the authors’ opinion, ESG ratings, used in isolation, are unlikely to make a material contribution to portfolio returns.
TOPIC: ESG investing


Key Findings
• Data are essential for making investment decisions, and most institutions rely wholly or partly on external providers of ESG data. However, there is minimal correlation between ESG ratings from alternative agencies.• This article explains why different raters’ appraisals diverge. The article also examines whether ESG is associated with subsequent fund or index outperformance.• Over the longest available period, ESG indexes did not outperform the “parent” index from which they are derived. Equally, however, for the two indexes that most closely represent what ESG investors actually do (FTSE4GOOD and MSCI-ESG) there is no evidence of underperformance.},

For both measures, we carry out empirical portfolio analyses with assets in either the STOXX Europe 600 or the Russell 1000 index. The ESG rating data analysis does not provide clear-cut evidence for enhanced performance of portfolios with either high or low ESG scores. We moreover illustrate that the choice of rating agency has an impact on the performance of ESG-constrained portfolios.

However, no significant relationship is found between the ESG rating of ETFs and their assets. On the contrary, it is revealed that the return of ETFs is negatively related to their ESG metrics.},

We find that the changes in ESG ratings have statistically significant short-term effects on their abnormal returns. However, their impacts on short-term abnormal returns decrease some days after the disclosure and become negative in the third year. The results imply that investors in the Korean stock market do not view corporate social responsibility activities as a means of supporting their long-term sustainability, judging from the firm value for a long period after their rating. Rather, based on the effects of the changes on coefficient signs over the period—positive in the year and the year after, no effects in the following year, and negative in the third year and later—we can infer that the short-term oriented market sentiments of investors might worsen their long-term stock performances, thus deteriorating their sustainability and growth opportunities.},

This study evaluated literature on investing in both emerging markets and integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) research-based strategies. This study examines real data on ESG and non-ESG integrated emerging market indices, both region-specific and country-specific. This examination includes measuring historical returns, beta, the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, the Conditional Value at Risk, skewness, and the Omega ratio for ESG and non-ESG integrated emerging market indices. Paired t-test analysis is incorporated in the measurement of the data. The results of the study indicate significant outperformance based on ESG integration. The implications of this study indicate that integrating ESG emerging market equities into institutional portfolios could provide institutional investors the opportunity for higher returns and lower downside risk than non-ESG equity investments.},

Such practices have their long-term impact on the stock returns and sustainable performance dynamics. This research aims to investigate the dynamic relationship between ESG indicators, stock returns, and sustainable performance reflected through economic, environmental, and social dimensions during 2010–2018. Panel data has been collected from various listed companies working in EU member states and analyzed through advanced panel estimations. The study findings inferred a significant and positive impact of all three measures of sustainable practices as reflected by targeted firms in the EU region on economic, environmental, and social dimensions of performance. On the other hand, those firms reporting higher ESG disclosure in their annual reports confirm better stock returns. Finally, study findings reveal that ESG dynamics provide a valuable contribution in creating some sustainable edge under the theoretical foundation of different theories. The study findings would greatly support providing a meaningful model for the listed firms to focus on their ESG indicators for higher performance in EES and stock returns. Finally, the current study expects to stimulate more theoretical and empirical work on ESG and EES. Future studies are suggested to consider the relationship between the stated variables regarding pre- and post-pandemic duration.},

Applying a return decomposition, we find that the puzzle can be explained by discount rate news. We find that discount rates of high-ESG stocks have fallen relative to low-ESG stocks.

Green bonds neither provide issuers with a price premium nor make investors sacrifice on lower returns. Socially responsible investing (SRI) funds generate no higher risk-adjusted long-term returns than non-SRI funds.

	abstract = {This paper shows how green investing spurs companies to mitigate their carbon emissions by raising the cost of capital of the most carbon-intensive companies. Companies’ emissions decrease when the wealth share of green investors and their sensitivity to climate externalities increase. We show that the impact of green investors primarily governs companies’ long-run emissions. Companies are further incentivized to reduce their emissions when green investors anticipate tighter climate regulations and climate-related technological innovations. However, heightened uncertainty regarding future climate risks alleviates green investors’ pressure on the cost of capital of companies and pushes them to increase their emissions. Calibrated on U.S. data, our model suggests that, albeit effective, the impact of green investors remains limited given their current wealth share and practices.

While this category of funds may look homogenous on the surface, the fact is that there is there is considerable variation in how funds choose to account for ESG concern in the investment portfolio. In this paper, we ask whether these strategic choices surrounding the implementation of ESG affect retail investors' perception of sustainable quality, financial quality, and/or perceived overall quality of the ESG-fund. Through two experiments (n = 261; n = 437), we find that choice of ESG-strategy (exclusion, inclusion, or engagement) impacts perceived mutual fund quality, with a marked preference for the inclusion strategy. Surprisingly, however, we find that the impact on overall fund quality is mediated by perceived financial quality, not perceived sustainable quality. In a similar fashion, we also find that implementing the strategy through in-house sustainability experts, as opposed to relying on external sustainability expertise, positively affect perceived quality, through perceived financial quality. In all, these results highlight that the manner in which ESG-factors are integrated in the investment portfolio can affect perceived quality of mutual funds, as investors consciously or unconsciously assign different financial expectations to the strategies.},

taxes applied at the register. We develop a theoretical framework for applied

a tax depends on its statutory incidence, and that even policies that induce no

            This paper studies the design of investment policies in defined contribution retirement systems. I estimate a dynamic system of correlated equations of lifecycle behavior that fully models the individual’s decision-making process to account for estimation biases. In the model, individuals make decisions that impact their retirement wealth within the Chilean retirement system. Behaviors are allowed to depend on risk preferences while modeling other sources of nonlinear unobserved heterogeneity. The estimated decision-making process allows us to simulate the effects of policy experiments (ex ante), such as defaulting individuals into riskier investment strategies or increasing contribution rates. The results indicate that individuals react by opting into safer plans despite their observed inertia and that increases in mandatory contributions generate little crowding out of other behaviors. Not modeling risk aversion and its endogeneity with behavior leads to substantial simulation biases.},

We consider a dynamic model solved by pension fund administrators and by consumers. We compare three different pricing schemes: (a) fees on contributions, (b) fees on returns, and (c) a two-part tariff including an auction over a guaranteed rate of return and allowing the firm to keep a portion of returns generated above this guaranteed rate. We also consider heterogeneity across individuals where agents earn high or low wages and high-wage customers have proportionally lower switching costs due to more cost-effective access to financial planning services. We find that auction participants subsidize consumers. We also treat savings as a durable good. In this case, pricing over returns worsens the switching related inefficiencies just described relative to pricing over contributions, despite the better incentives it provides. These inefficiencies can be resolved by allowing firms to price discriminate.},

Given the haste, the long-term impacts and their heterogeneity have scarcely been analyzed. Using Monte Carlo simulations on the Chilean Social Protection Survey linked with administrative data, this study quantifies the effects of a 10\% early release of pension funds. Each withdrawn dollar brings losses of 1.59 dollars in future retirement savings, reducing monthly pension benefits by 7.26\%. This policy raises income inadequacy and inequality in retirement, increasing government expenditure by 4.33\% to counteract these effects for 65-year-old retirees. We propose four policies to mitigate these effects and address the current challenges of most defined contribution pension schemes. Increasing contributions combined with an intragenerational solidarity component shows the biggest impacts. Contribution enforcement, reducing tax evasion, and delaying retirement by at least 1 year via incentives have lower but significant effects.},

Here, we take an agent-based approach to model investor decision making in the electricity sector by modelling investors as actors with different (heterogeneous) anticipations of the future. With only a limited set of assumptions, this generic model replicates the dynamics of the liberalised electricity market of the last decades and points out dynamics that are to be expected as the energy transition progresses. Importantly, these dynamics are emergent properties of the evolving electricity system resulting from actor (investor) behaviour. We have experimented with varying carbon price scenarios and find that incorporating heterogeneous investor behaviour results in a large bandwidth of possible transition pathways, and that the depth of renewables penetration is correlated with the variability of their power generation pattern. Furthermore, a counter-intuitive trend was observed, namely that average profits of investors are seen to increase with carbon prices. These results are a vivid and generic illustration that outcome-based policy cannot be solely based on market instruments that rely on perfect rational and perfectly informed agents.},

But, highly intermittent nature of renewable energy resources and their higher rate of outages make bidding strategies inefficient. To solve these issues, this study suggests an optimal bidding strategy considering uncertainty of renewable energy resources and DRP based on their outage probabilities. Tent chaos mapping is used to generate load scenarios and all possible renewable power output scenarios within the confidence intervals in non-repetitive and adaptive manner. Reserve and penalty costs for incorrect estimation of renewable energies are invoked to design more robust bidding. Moreover, the risk of participation in the competitive energy market is assessed using CVaR criteria.

In the European Union, balancing markets are undergoing substantial regulatory changes driven the efforts to harmonize the market design and better align it with the goals of the energy transition. It is proposed to decouple the balancing energy (real-time) market from the (forward) balancing capacity market and the price of balancing energy will be based on the marginal bid. In this paper, the potential effects of these changes on market participants’ strategies are analyzed using an agent-based model. This model compares the effects of a standalone balancing energy market with different pricing rules on economic efficiency with agents that apply naïve, rule-based and reinforcement-learning strategies. The results indicate that the introduction of a standalone balancing energy market reduces the cost of balancing, even in a concentrated market with strategic bidders. Marginal pricing consistently leads to lower weighted average prices than pay-as-bid pricing, regardless of the level of competition. Nevertheless, in an oligopoly with actors bidding strategically, prices can deviate from the competitive benchmark by a factor of 4–5. This implies that the introduction of a standalone balancing energy market does not entirely solve the issue of strategic bidding, but helps dampen the prices, as compared to the balancing market prior to the design change.},

It describes firms that face uncertainty about future demand and prices; use heuristic rules to decide production levels, trading prices, and technology adoption; and are heterogeneous in terms of production factors, abatement costs, and trading behavior. Using multiple evaluation criteria and a wide range of parameter values, we find that the main difference between the two policies lies in the fact that permit prices fall after successful abatement. This can lead to higher production levels under permit trading, but can also drive emission-efficient firms out of the market. Scarcity rents under permit trading can further create higher profit rates for firms, the extent of which is shown to depend on the mechanisms for market-clearing and initial allocation.},

	abstract = {Scientifically selecting the optimal sustainable photovoltaic module supplier can not only reduce investment costs but also increase generation profits, which is highly valued by decision-makers. However, some deficiencies such as information loss, weight deviation and the lack of psychological characteristic analysis lie in the present supplier selection studies, which greatly weakens the evaluation accuracy. To fill such gap, a novel decision framework under mixed information environment is proposed. First, triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are adopted to depict the fuzziness and hesitancy of expert knowledge, which avoids information distortion. Then, under the consideration of logic importance and decision-making contribution, an approach combining the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy theory is used to compute index importance, which makes full use of expert experience and information content amount. Subsequently, the cumulative prospect theory is introduced to rank alternatives with the assumptions of bounded rationality and risk preference. Finally, a case study is conducted based on the proposed framework. Results show that product quality attributes, especially photoelectric conversion efficiency, degradation rate and environmental adaptability, are the primary considerations in the issue. Since environmental measures vary widely among suppliers and own a relatively high weight, they may become the core competitiveness of sustainable suppliers. Besides, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that psychological characteristics like reference dependence and loss aversion greatly affect the ranking. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that with the right economic incentives, electrification of transport can significantly reduce CO2 emissions by 2050. Estimates of future emissions from car transport tend, though, to ignore technological change in electricity generation and bounded rationality of consumers. In this article we address these two shortcomings by developing a novel approach that captures the dynamic interdependence between the car industry and electricity generation. We assess how incorporating realistic behaviors affects estimates of emissions from passengers cars in four models of vehicle adoption, namely with rational, myopic, habit-oriented and loss aversive consumers. This is then combined with three behavioral models of travel distance, describing rational, habitual and loss-averse drivers. In the electricity sector, technological change occurs through installation of new power plants embodying different energy technologies. This allows us to study the impact of policies promoting renewable energy on the price of electricity, and indirectly on the rate of adoption of electric cars. The findings indicate that substituting renewable energy for fossil fuels in electricity generation by 2050 can triple the electricity price. This undermines the positive effect of subsidies on electric car adoption, with the specific effect depending on particular behaviors assumed to hold. In addition, we show that myopic and loss-averse consumers buy on average less fuel-efficient cars than rational agents. Habitual drivers tend to commute larger distances than rational ones, as they do not adjust their behavior optimally to changes in fuel prices and improvements in fuel efficiencies. These behavioral effects contribute to the rebound effect. Our findings indicate that vehicle choice and driving under rational behavior generate consistently the lowest estimates of life-cycle emissions. By ignoring more realistic behaviors consistent with bounded rationality, current studies underestimate emissions from passenger cars, in turn contributing to overly optimistic expectations about policy impacts.

	abstract = {The energy sector transition requires large financial investments in low-carbon generation technologies, to be delivered by a variety of actors with heterogeneous characteristics. Real-world actors have bounded-rationality, reflected by their limited foresight and heterogeneous expectations, and as past trends influence their investments. Agent-based models are highly suitable modelling frameworks to study such realistic and complex energy transition dynamics. This paper introduces BRAIN-Energy, a novel agent-based model which explicitly allows to explore the impacts of actors' heterogeneous characteristics, and of their interactions, on the transition pathways of the UK, German and Italian electricity sectors. Results show that actors' heterogeneous characteristics pose barriers to effective decarbonisation efforts, affect the speed of the transition, and impact the transition's security of supply and affordability dimensions. Limited foresight and path-dependency lead to investment cycles (both virtuous and vicious). The country comparison highlights how such effects are stronger in markets with more heterogeneous market players.},

	abstract = {In the power market, each entity is not completely rational when generate strategy, and the market information held by each entity is not exactly the same. In this paper, duopoly power providers with different selling adjustment structures are simplified from the actual grid background, where one provider can sell part of its power to another at contract price to store the power. Each provider is trying to maximize its profit by adjusting its power selling strategy. The process of evolutionary game with multi-periods bounded rational is established. One provider adjusts its selling strategy through the multi-periods market price and another through its multi-periods marginal profit. The quantity of power sold by each provider will tend to Nash equilibrium and how information asymmetry affects the stability of Nash equilibrium is analyzed through comparing dynamic power selling with and without information asymmetry. Information asymmetry has a great impact on one provider but not another. The numerical simulations also show that the information asymmetry will increase the stability region of the system. Different adjustment suggestions are proposed for different providers when information asymmetry occurs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117608},
	abstract = {In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, countries worldwide are transforming their energy systems with higher shares of renewable energy and smart technologies for demand response. Microgrids play an essential role in the transformation of electric grids to smart grids. However, renewable sources present new challenges, particularly those of high variability, which creates uncertainties in the supply side that can affect the security of electricity access at affordable prices. This paper proposes a novel Stackelberg stochastic model to account for different sources of uncertainty. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) with uncertainty regarding the availability of wind and solar sources and electricity prices. Availability of renewable sources is modeled via chance constraints, which allows assessing the risk of microgrids over-committing supply levels. Uncertainty in electricity prices is modeled via a set of demand scenarios with a given probability distribution. The lower-level problem of the Stackelberg problem considers an electricity dispatch problem for each demand scenario. The proposed model allows measuring the strategic actions of microgrids when facing different types of uncertainties and how the smart grid should adapt to guarantee that demand levels are supplied. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We find that microgrids risk levels above 30\% do not correlate with further benefits, such as reduced electricity prices. We also identified that in average, depending on the social cost of carbon and demand level, microgrids can cover their own demand and supply 15\% of the electricity demand in the grid.},

	issn = {0360-5442},
	doi = {10.1016/j.energy.2022.123793},
	abstract = {With the worldwide restructuring of power markets, it is more meaningful to analyze the bidding behaviors of generation companies (GENCOs). A realistic bidding behavior model can help to design better power market mechanisms. However, most existing studies usually use strong assumptions, where all GENCOs behave perfectly rationally when participating in power markets. Many GENCOs' observed bidding behaviors are proved to deviate from the simulated perfectly rational ones. Thus, it is significant to introduce individual subjective perspectives into the bidding behavior modeling to obtain more realistic models. Although several studies have been working on this topic by introducing bounded rationality, they still have some problems in modeling bounded rationality, power system operation, power market rules, etc. This paper proposes a novel bidding behavior model for GENCOs under bounded rationality with renewable energy to overcome these problems. The introduced bounded rationality features include prospect theory in the form of framing effects and the concept of fairness constraints on profit-making. A Stackelberg game model is formulated to analyze the interaction between a GENCO with renewables and a day-ahead power market. The proposed model is nonlinear, which is further transformed into a mixed-integer linear formulation by applying Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem and strong duality theorem. Based on a modified IEEE-30 bus system with high renewable, an illustrative example is proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and analyze the bidding behaviors of bounded rational GENCOs and the corresponding effects on power markets.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

The argument that corporate managers should replace their singular focus on shareholders with a broader vision, where they also serve other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and society, has found a receptive audience with corporate CEOs and institutional investors. The pitch that companies should focus on doing good is sweetened with the promise that it will also be good for their bottom line and for shareholders. In this article, we build a framework for value that will allow us to examine how being socially responsible can manifest in the tangible ingredients of value and look at the evidence for whether being socially responsible is creating value for companies and for investors.

• For ESG to increase company value, actions taken to improve ESG ratings have to result in either higher cash flows or lower risk, and there is the very real possibility that being good can lower value for some firms.• The evidence that being good improves a company’s operating performance (increases cashflows) is weak but there is more solid backing for the proposition that being bad can make funding more expensive (higher costs of equity and debt).• Investing in companies that are recognized by the market as good companies is likely to decrease, rather than increase, investor returns, but investing in companies that are good, before the market recognizes and prices in the goodness, has a much better chance of success.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that extraordinary average returns may be obtained by trading equity index options, and that at least part of this abnormal performance is attributable to volatility and jump risk premia. This paper asks whether such priced risk factors are alone sufficient to explain these average returns. To provide an answer in as general as possible a setting, I estimate a flexible class of nonlinear models using all S\&P 500 Index futures options traded between 1986 and 2000. The results show that priced factors contribute to these expected returns but are insufficient to explain their magnitudes, particularly for short-term out-of-the-money puts.},

This approach grew out of the lack of independent measurements at the spatial and temporal scales of interest. Issues of dependent and independent data are considered as well as the temporal and spatial relationships of the data. The result is a multifaceted examination of the uncertainty associated with fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission estimates. The three assessments collectively give a range that spans from 1.0 to 13\% (2 σ). Greatly simplifying the assessments give a global fossil fuel carbon dioxide uncertainty value of 8.4\% (2 σ). In the largest context presented, the determination of fossil fuel emission uncertainty is important for a better understanding of the global carbon cycle and its implications for the physical, economic and political world.},

	doi = {10.5194/bg-12-2565-2015},
	abstract = {Over the last 5 decades monitoring systems have been developed to detect changes in the accumulation of carbon (C) in the atmosphere and ocean; however, our ability to detect changes in the behavior of the global C cycle is still hindered by measurement and estimate errors. Here we present a rigorous and flexible framework for assessing the temporal and spatial components of estimate errors and their impact on uncertainty in net C uptake by the biosphere. We present a novel approach for incorporating temporally correlated random error into the error structure of emission estimates. Based on this approach, we conclude that the 2σ uncertainties of the atmospheric growth rate have decreased from 1.2 Pg C yr −1 in the 1960s to 0.3 Pg C yr −1 in the 2000s due to an expansion of the atmospheric observation network. The 2σ uncertainties in fossil fuel emissions have increased from 0.3 Pg C yr −1 in the 1960s to almost 1.0 Pg C yr −1 during the 2000s due to differences in national reporting errors and differences in energy inventories. Lastly, while land use emissions have remained fairly constant, their errors still remain high and thus their global C uptake uncertainty is not trivial. Currently, the absolute errors in fossil fuel emissions rival the total emissions from land use, highlighting the extent to which fossil fuels dominate the global C budget. Because errors in the atmospheric growth rate have decreased faster than errors in total emissions have increased, a ∼ 20 \% reduction in the overall uncertainty of net C global uptake has occurred. Given all the major sources of error in the global C budget that we could identify, we are 93 \% confident that terrestrial C uptake has increased and 97 \% confident that ocean C uptake has increased over the last 5 decades. Thus, it is clear that arguably one of the most vital ecosystem services currently provided by the biosphere is the continued removal of approximately half of atmospheric CO 2 emissions from the atmosphere, although there are certain environmental costs associated with this service, such as the acidification of ocean waters.},

	abstract = {Both risk-averse behavior and strategic bidding may distort the outcome of energy and capacity markets. Although these two behavioral aspects may trigger similar bidding behavior and investments into generation capacity, they are fundamentally different. While in the literature risk-aversion and strategic behavior have been investigated separately, the presented research offers a comparative analysis to identify situations in which both types of behavior result in the same outcome. First, a framework is introduced in which both strategic and risk-averse behavior can be investigated for a generation expansion planning problem. The problem including the risk-averse investor is modeled as a Nash-equilibrium problem and solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, whereas the Stackelberg game between the strategic agent and the markets is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem and solved using disjunctive constraints. Using a set of 1920 problem instances we reveal that the distinguishability of the two types of behavior is highly technology-dependent and influenced by the way the capacity target is set. Implications of this work may support regulators in disentangling risk-aversion and strategic behavior based on observed market outcomes.},

Integer Programs), which is free for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code. This paper gives
an overview of the main design concepts of SCIP and how it can be used to solve constraint integer programs. To illustrate
the performance and flexibility of SCIP, we apply it to two different problem classes. First, we consider mixed integer programming
and show by computational experiments that SCIP is almost competitive to specialized commercial MIP solvers, even though SCIP
supports the more general constraint integer programming paradigm. We develop new ingredients that improve current MIP solving
technology. As a second application, we employ SCIP to solve chip design verification problems as they arise in the logic
design of integrated circuits. This application goes far beyond traditional MIP solving, as it includes several highly non-linear
constraints, which can be handled nicely within the constraint integer programming framework. We show anecdotally how the
different solving techniques from MIP, CP, and SAT work together inside SCIP to deal with such constraint classes. Finally,
experimental results show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for proving the validity of properties
on circuits containing arithmetic.},

	abstract = {Inattention is a central, unifying theme for much of behavioral economics. It permeates such disparate fields as microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, public economics, and industrial organization. It enables us to think in a rather consistent way about behavioral biases, speculate about their origins, and trace out their implications for market outcomes. This survey first discusses the most basic models of attention, using a fairly unified framework. Then, it discusses the methods used to measure attention, which present a number of challenges on which a great deal of progress has been achieved, although much more work needs to be done. It then examines the various theories of attention, both behavioral and more Bayesian. It finally discusses some applications. For instance, inattention offers a way to write a behavioral version of basic microeconomics, as in consumer theory and Arrow–Debreu. A last section is devoted to open questions in the attention literature. This chapter is a pedagogical guide to the literature on attention. Derivations are self-contained.},

	abstract = {The review process for academic journals in economics has grown vastly more extensive over time. Journals demand more revisions, and papers have become bloated with numerous robustness checks and extensions. Even if the extra resulting revisions do on average lead to improved papers—a claim that is debatable—the cost is enormous. We argue that much of the time involved in these revisions is a waste of research effort. Another cause for concern is the level of disagreement amongst referees, a pattern that suggests a high level of arbitrariness in the review process. To identify and highlight what is going right and what is going wrong in the reviewing process, we wrote to a sample of former editors of the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Econometrica, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Journal of Financial Economics, and asked them for their thoughts about what might improve the process. We found a rough consensus that referees for top journals in economics tend to make similar, correctable mistakes. The italicized quotations throughout this paper are drawn from our correspondence with these editors and our own experience. Their insights are consistent with our own experiences as editors at the Journal of Finance and the Review of Financial Studies. Our objective is to highlight these mistakes and provide a roadmap for how to avoid them.},

UPC has the same undominated perfect equilibria as standard provision point (PPM) and proportional rebate (PR) mechanisms, and UPA a somewhat broader set. However, our mechanisms' different marginal penalty structures may facilitate equilibrium selection and lead to higher contributions and more frequent provision. Through laboratory experiments, using both homogeneous (symmetric) and heterogeneous induced values, we show our mechanisms improve upon PR and PPM: UPC generates higher aggregate contributions than PR and PPM, leading to higher provision rates than PPM; UPA attracts much higher contributions, although it provides less frequently. This ranking emerges because high offers are more common (especially among high value people in the heterogeneous environment) in the uniform price mechanisms, where higher offers only increase the payment when needed for provision.},

Three of these have been chosen here to illustrate the general point: The theory of taxation and risk taking with focus on portfolio choice, the role of uncertainty in public expenditure analysis (emphasising the effect of public goods provision on private risk taking) and the theory of tax evasion and compliance.},

	abstract = {Cleantech venture capital investment differs from the typical venture capital investment in that it tends to be very capital intensive and faces greater technology risks associated with the functioning of the technology, scalability and exit requirements than the typical venture capital investment. Moreover, unlike the typical venture capital investment, the benefits arising from cleantech cannot be totally captured by the venture capitalist as many of its benefits accrue to society via reduced environmental degradation and better health and quality of life outcomes. The public goods literature posits that such externalities reduce investment in cleantech below the socially optimal level. We seek to determine whether there are countervailing factors which may incite greater cleantech investment. We argue that oil prices, increased stakeholder attention, as well as the impact of various formal and informal institutions are such factors. This paper provides a cross-country analysis of the determinants of cleantech venture capital investment with a unique worldwide dataset of 31 countries spanning 1996–2010. The data show consistent evidence of a pronounced role for oil prices in driving cleantech venture capital deals, which is more important than other economic, legal or institutional variables. Cleantech media coverage is likewise a statistically significant determinant of cleantech venture capital investment and as economically significant as other country level legal, governance, and cultural variables. Uncertainty avoidance has a negative impact on cleantech venture capital investment, as well as a moderating effect on other variables.},

We focus on the relationship between tenure (and promotion) and time allocation, and we find that tenure and promotion do affect the allocation of time. The specific trade-offs are related to particular career paths. For example, full professors spend increasing time on service at the expense of teaching and research while longer-term associate professors who have not been promoted to full professor spend significantly more time teaching at the expense of research time. Finally, our results suggest that women, on average, allocate more hours to university service and less time to research than do men.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the effects of tax incentives on charitable contributions in the UK, using the universe of self-assessment income tax returns between 2005 and 2013. We exploit variation from a large reform in 2010 to estimate intensive- and extensive-margin tax-price elasticities of giving. Using a predicted-tax-rate instrument for the price of giving relative to consumption, we find an intensive-margin elasticity of about − 0.2 and an extensive-margin elasticity of − 0.1, yielding a total elasticity of about − 0.3. To further explore the extensive-margin response, we propose a model with a fixed cost of declaring donations and obtain a structural estimate of that cost of around £47. We also study the welfare effects of tax incentives, extending the theoretical literature to allow for extensive-margin giving and for a fixed cost of declaring donations. Taking into account these factors, there is a case for increasing the subsidy on charitable giving in the UK.},

While a standard model of oligopolistic for-profit competition predicts a positive relationship between market size and firm size, our analogous model of competition between prosocially motivated charities predicts no such correlation. If charities are biased towards their own provision, a positive association between market size and provider size can arise. We examine these predictions empirically for six different local charity markets. Our empirical findings suggest that charities do not solely pursue prosocial objectives, and that increased competition in the charity sector can lead to rationalization in provision.},

Here we used a naturalistic reading task combined with an attentional sampling method to examine the effects of mind wandering—and the subsequent metacognitive awareness of its occurrence—on eye movements and pupillary dynamics. Our goal was to better understand the attentional and metacognitive processes involved in the initiation and termination of mind wandering episodes. Our results show that changes in eye behavior are consistent with underlying independent cognitive mechanisms working in tandem to sustain the attentional resources required for focused reading. In addition to changes in blink frequency, blink duration, and the number of saccades, variations in eye movements during unaware distractions point to a loss of the perceptual asymmetry that is usually observed in attentive, left-to-right reading. Also, before self-detected distractions, we observed a specific increase in pupillary diameter, indicating the likely presence of an anticipatory autonomic process that could contribute to becoming aware of the current attentional state. These findings stress the need for further research tackling the temporal structure of attentional dynamics during tasks that have a significant real-world impact.},

As a means to reduce the potential for response bias on the follow-up bid in multiple-bound discrete choice formats such as the DB model while maintaining much of the efficiency gains of the multiple-bound approach, we introduce the one-and-one-half-bound (OOHB) approach and present a real-world application. In a laboratory setting, despite the fact that the OOHB model uses less information than the DB approach, the efficiency gains in moving from SB to OOHB capture a large portion of the gain associated with moving from SB to DB. Utilizing distribution-free seminonparametric estimation techniques on a split-survey data set, our OOHB estimates demonstrated higher consistency with respect to the follow-up data than the DB estimates and were more efficient as well. Hence, OOHB may serve as a viable alternative to the DB format in situations where follow-up response bias may be a concern.},

The models lost some of their appeal at the inception of restructuring even though they still offer a lot of possibilities and are in many respect irreplaceable provided they are adapted to the new environment. We introduce stochastic equilibrium versions of these models that we believe provide a relevant context for looking at the current very risky market where the power industry invests and operates. We then take up different questions raised by the new environment. Some are due to developments of the industry like demand side management: an optimization framework has difficulties accommodating them but the more general equilibrium paradigm offers additional possibilities. We then look at the insertion of risk-related investment practices that developed with the new environment and may not be easy to accommodate in an optimization context. Specifically we consider the use of plant-specific discount rates that we derive by including stochastic discount rates in the equilibrium model. Linear discount factors only price systematic risk. We therefore complete the discussion by inserting different risk functions (for different agents) in order to account for additional unpriced idiosyncratic risk in investments. These different models can be cast in a single mathematical representation but they do not have the same mathematical properties. We illustrate the impact of these phenomena on a small but realistic example.},

Primary data relating to MO and SO were collected by survey questionnaire, while secondary data on sustainable performance were collected from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability report. Findings The results reveal that SO not only enhances strategic positioning and activities linked to market intelligence, but also serves as a determining factor of superior performance. The findings provide new insights into how MO is connected with sustainable corporate performance. Practical implications The impact of this study leads to improvements in planning marketing and in market intelligence process, which are essential activities of managers and marketing planners. There are also implications for other organizational processes. The authors point out the relevance including multi-stakeholders, whose impact is perceived in the organization's results, and improving relations with them. Originality/value The authors' first contribution is empirically examining organizational competence with regard to the MO and marketing intelligence that have the greatest impact on sustainable performance.

They tend to be strongly values-driven and to adopt an investment time horizon of 7+ years for their impact investments, which they expect to yield financial returns that are no different from those of traditional investments. Interestingly, these investors perceive the well-established sustainable investing strategies of exclusion, environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration and best-in-class as not having high impact-generating potential. Practical implications Suggestions are provided about how wealthy private investors could use the findings to improve their impact investment decisions. Advice is offered to investment professionals on how to optimize impact investment products and services for this economically and societally highly relevant target group. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first scientific study to investigate the general characteristics and investment behavior of HNWIs who pursue impact investing. HNWIs have great relevance for financial markets yet they are out of reach for most researchers. As a result, they are poorly understood, and apparently also often misunderstood, which has substantial economic and social implications that this paper helps mitigate.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the motives, behavior, and characteristics shaping mutual fund managers’ willingness to incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into investment decision making. Using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon and the higher their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. We also find that the propensity to incorporate ESG factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of salary change and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in remuneration. Overall, our evidence suggests that ESG diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important as a tool for additional value creation. The prevalent use of ESG criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers.},

	abstract = {Following calls by social, environmental, and corporate governance advocacy groups on the need for investors to take environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into consideration when making investment decisions, this research looks at responsible investment and its impact on investor decision-making. Using a Likert scale structured questionnaire, data are gathered on the key factors considered when making investment decisions and on the extent to which the inclusion of ESG variables may influence investment decisions. Using a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) correlation analysis, together with linear and ordinal regression analysis, the findings reveal that there is no significant relationship between ESG factors and investment decisions. It is therefore recommended that third parties—private institutions such as nongovernmental organizations—should intervene through policy recommendations, awareness campaigns, and advocacy to ensure that individual investors and entities do consider ESG factors in their investment decision-making and processes. It is also recommended that firms should disclose the extent to which they factor ESG issues into their investment decision-making.
TOPICS: Portfolio theory, portfolio construction, ESG investing


Key Findings
• In Zimbabwe, ESG factors have no significant influence on the investor’s decision to invest.• The currently prevailing statutory frameworks, in Zimbabwe, do not suffice to make an investment responsible.• Private institutions, policymakers, and investors should work together to shape the investment framework and close the significant gap between investor interests and knowledge about responsible investment.},

The competition and risk that now prevail in the sector may require a more refined analysis. We consider a competitive market with agents investing in some mix of capacities: the risk exposure of a plant and the attitude towards risk of the owner depend on the plant and the portfolio of its capacities. They may also depend on hedging contracts acquired by the investor on the market if such contracts exist. We represent these effects through equilibrium models of generation capacity in incomplete markets. The models come in different versions depending on the portfolio of physical plants and hedging contracts. These modify the long-term risk of the plants, the attitude of the owners towards risk, and hence the incentive to invest. The models involve risk-averse producers and consumers, and their behavior is represented by convex risk measures. We use degree theory to prove existence and explore multiplicity of equilibrium solutions.},

This paper analyzes the effect of a European CPF in the reformed EU ETS using a Hotelling model of the EU ETS, amended by the market stability reserve (MSR), and the cancellation mechanism. Two CPF designs are compared: (1) a buyback program and (2) a top-up tax. The buyback program sets a minimum price for the allowances from the implementation year onwards. After the announcement, firms anticipate the CPF, which immediately increases the carbon price to the discounted CPF level. Therefore, firms emit less and bank more allowances, leading to more intake into the MSR, and more cancellation of allowances. The top-up tax imposes a tax on emissions, which enhances the market price of allowances to the CPF level from the implementation year onwards. Firms increase their short-run emissions in anticipation of the upcoming tax. Only after the implementation year firms start to lower their emissions. Thus, the effect on aggregate cancellation is ambiguous. Despite being equivalent in a static setting, the design choice for the CPF matters in a dynamic context, such as the EU ETS.},

Profit-neutral permit allocations are defined as the number of permits that the regulator should give for free so that post-regulation profits (i.e. a firm's profits in the products market plus the value of the allowances granted for free) are equal to pre-regulation profits. The proposed model is developed by assuming that firms use polluting technologies and compete “à la Cournot”. The paper demonstrates that a low number of free allowances is sufficient to meet these two goals. Moreover, the regulator can fully offset losses, even when the reduction in emissions is high, provided that the sectors concerned are not monopolies, both for isoelastic and linear demand functions.},

We extend previous work to simultaneously include both leakage and volatility. We study how OBA permits can be implemented under an overall cap that may change with the level of production in contrast with a design that deducts OBA permits from the overall permit allocation as is the current practice in the EU-ETS and California.

We focus on a game in which bubbles, if they arise, are irrational, as in the Smith, Suchanek, and Williams (1988)’s set up. Our theoretical results are based on Camerer and Ho (1999)’s Experience-Weighted Attraction learning model. Adaptive traders are assumed to adjust their behavior according to actions’ past performance. In the long run, learning induces the market to converge to the unique no bubble equilibrium. However, learning initially increases traders’ propensity to speculate. In the short run, more experienced traders thus create more bubbles. An experiment shows that bubbles are very pervasive despite the fact that subjects have become experienced. Our estimation of the EWA model also indicates that learning is at work.},

	abstract = {This chapter is a survey of literature on the management, supervision, and measurement of extreme and infrequent risks in finance. Extreme risks are the risks of very large losses per dollar invested. As losses associated to extreme risks occur infrequently, investors tend to become less alert to these risks over time. A series of bank failures, due to mismanaged portfolios of corporate loans, real estate, and complex derivatives, was a painful reminder of the existence of extreme risks. It prompted new regulations and research on new instruments of risk protection. The implementation of the common guidelines for risk supervision was a very ambitious initiative designed to address a variety of risks. These risks can be divided into three categories: market risk, credit risk or risk of default, and liquidity risk or risk of counterparty. In 1995, the governors of Central Banks gathered in Basle (Switzerland) and adopted a mandatory risk measure called the Value at Risk to be calculated by all banks for each line of their balance sheets. Since then, banks have been required to report the Value at Risk to the regulators and update it daily and hold a sufficient amount of capital (the so-called required capital) as a hedge against extreme risks.},

Historical simulation (HS) is widely used in practice because of two reasons: the ease with which it is implemented and its model-free nature. The HS technique is very easy to implement, there are no parameters that are to be estimated by maximum likelihood or any other method; therefore, no numerical optimization is performed. The HS technique is modelfree, as it does not rely on any particular parametric model such as a RiskMetrics model for variance and a normal distribution for the standardized returns. VaR is the most popular risk measure in use and HS is the most often used methodology to compute VaR.},

Our main finding is that in a complete risk market---when all uncertainties can be replicated by financial products---a risky design equilibrium problem collapses to what we call a risky design game, i.e., a stochastic Nash game in which the original design agents act as risk neutral and there emerges an additional system risk agent. The system risk agent simultaneously prices risk and determines the probability density used by the other agents for their risk neutral evaluations. This situation is stochastic-endogenous: the probability density used by agents to value uncertain investments is endogenous to the risky design equilibrium problem. This result is most striking when design agents use coherent risk measures in which case the intersection of their risk sets turns out to be a risk set for the system risk agent, thereby extending existing results for risk markets. We also investigate existence of equilibria in both the complete and incomplete cases.},

	abstract = {I develop a dynamic model of individual lifetime behavior and jointly estimate a set of correlated dynamic equations for observed risk aversion, wealth-related decisions (employment, occupation, investment, and savings), and other characteristics that an individual may value independently of wealth (family and health). I consider how to incorporate observed measures of individual risk aversion (calculated from survey responses) into an empirical model and how to reconcile the use of these measures with the economic theory of individual behavior over time. In an empirical model that allows risk preferences to be an endogenous determinant of observed behaviors, I ﬁnd that there is correlation, through unobserved characteristics, between risk aversion and wealth-related behaviors, as well as causal eﬀect of risk preferences on these outcomes. The joint estimation of observed risk aversion and behaviors reduces the bias on the estimated marginal eﬀects of endogenous variables that impact wealth-related decisions and better approximate the distribution of individual unobserved heterogeneity. The estimated model is used to analyze policies associated with wealth accumulation in the Chilean private retirement system. I propose alternative time-varying default investment schemes showing that, over seven years, slightly riskier investment strategies may increase individual asset accumulation by eight percent or more. Increases in mandatory contribution rates by three and ﬁve percent generate statistically signiﬁcant increases in asset accumulation of 10 and 16 percent, respectively.},

	abstract = {Cap-and-trade regulation is an effective mechanism to control carbon emissions. The optimization problem for a two-stage supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer under cap-and-trade regulation was investigated in this paper. Consumers\&rsquo; low-carbon awareness level was considered in the decision models. Optimal decision policies, corresponding emissions, and profits were calculated for decentralized and centralized decision-making modes. Under a decentralized mode, the two-stage supply-chain optimization problem was formulated as a Stackelberg game model, where the manufacturer and retailer were the leader and follower, respectively. The manufacturer decides the emission-reduction levels per product unit and the retailer decides the retail price per unit product. The optimal decisions are derived using the reverse-solution method. By contrast, the two-stage supply-chain optimization problem under a decentralized mode was formulated as a single-level optimization model. The nonlinear model is handled by KKT optimality conditions. The influence of the regulation parameters (caps and carbon prices) and consumers\&rsquo; low-carbon awareness on the optimal decision policies, the corresponding emissions, and profits is discussed in detail. A comparison between the two modes implies that the decentralized mode is dominated by the centralized mode in terms of profit and emissions. In order to provoke the decision makers under decentralized modes to make the decisions under the decentralized mode, a profit-sharing contract was designed. This study shows that higher consumer low-carbon awareness and carbon prices can improve the manufacturer-decision flexibility when there exists a profit-sharing contract. Finally, numerical experiments confirmed the analytical results.},

This paper addresses that argument and concludes that cap-and-trade will need to be accompanied by complementary regulatory measures. While it is a necessary component in a climate mitigation programme, it is unlikely to be sufficient by itself to accomplish the desired emission reductions. The paper reviews the evidence on how SO2 emissions were reduced and the extent to which actual emission trading was responsible for the reduction as opposed to other innovations. It also identifies differences between the past regulation of SO2 and other air pollutants and the challenges presented by the regulation of GHG emissions. What actually happened in the US with SO2 emission trading deviated in several significant respects from what would be predicted based on the conventional theoretical analysis. While there was a dramatic reduction in SO2 emissions, it occurred because of several factors, some of which are unlikely to apply for GHG emissions, and others of which argue for an activist regulatory policy by the government as a complement to the functioning of an emissions market for GHGs.},

Second, among cap-and-trade mechanisms, we examine only those that target pollution abatement, and so we do not include applications to natural resource management, such as individual transferable quota systems used to regulate fisheries.

They establish an emission limit which carbon emission generating enterprises is permitted. To avoid penalties caused by excessive emissions or to gain profits by selling saved portions of the allowance in the carbon trading market, enterprises can invest in green technology for achieving emission reduction which results in increasing cost and leads to a change in pricing strategies. This paper formulates mathematical models to quantify the optimal green technology investment and product pricing, and compare the effects of the two allocation rules on these operational decisions and total emission. The analytical results indicate that compared to benchmarking the optimal product price under the grandfathering rule is higher. Grandfathering will induce greater emission reduction. However, benchmarking is more likely to encourage enterprises to invest in green technologies for improving their energy efficiency. Moreover, the initial emission allowance under the grandfathering rule will not affect the green technology investment. However, the benchmark emission intensity will influence the green technology decision under the benchmarking rule. When choosing from two green technologies, investment in cleaner green technologies will not be authorized, in some instances, under a range of scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper studies government subsidies for green technology adoption while considering the manufacturing industry’s response. Government subsidies offered directly to consumers impact the supplier’s production and pricing decisions. Our analysis expands the current understanding of the price-setting newsvendor model, incorporating the external influence from the government, who is now an additional player in the system. We quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government, industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that, for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of underserving customers with high valuations. We also show that when policy makers such as governments ignore demand uncertainty when designing consumer subsidies, they can significantly miss the desired adoption target level. From a coordination perspective, we demonstrate that the decentralized decisions are also optimal for a central planner managing jointly the supplier and the government. As a result, subsidies provide a coordination mechanism.

We find that despite the significant differences between pension fund manager returns, they are statistically similar to our style benchmarks for all fund types. Furthermore, accounting for currency hedging improves the accuracy of the replicating portfolios and the selection return estimates.

	abstract = {In this work, we study an alternative approach for capping and pricing carbon emissions in electric markets: the cap-and-trade paradigm with re-trade of allowances. We model the electric market (generators and allowances’ auctioneer) as a two stage stochastic capacity expansion equilibrium problem, where we allow future investment and re-trading of emission permits among generators. The model studies generation and future investments in the electric sector in two regimes of demand: deterministic and stochastic. The configuration enforces the reduction of carbon emissions by setting a carbon budget, which allows to assess the impact of green policies and pledges concerning an electric system. We use the proposed model to analyze the Chilean electric sector under a cap-and-trade paradigm as an alternative to the existing carbon tax. We show that the Chilean pledge regarding emissions reductions does not encourage a shift to greener technologies. Moreover, we characterize two strategies to comply with the renewable targets by mid-century. On the one hand, a stringent carbon budget that induces high price of carbon permits and phases out coal-based generators. On the other hand, a less stringent target which significantly encourages investment in renewable technologies, but with low remaining shares of coal-based electric generation towards 2050.},

	abstract = {Measurement of pupil size (pupillometry) has recently gained renewed interest from psychologists, but there is little agreement on how pupil-size data is best analyzed. Here we focus on one aspect of pupillometric analyses: baseline correction, i.e., analyzing changes in pupil size relative to a baseline period. Baseline correction is useful in experiments that investigate the effect of some experimental manipulation on pupil size. In such experiments, baseline correction improves statistical power by taking into account random fluctuations in pupil size over time. However, we show that baseline correction can also distort data if unrealistically small pupil sizes are recorded during the baseline period, which can easily occur due to eye blinks, data loss, or other distortions. Divisive baseline correction (corrected pupil size = pupil size/baseline) is affected more strongly by such distortions than subtractive baseline correction (corrected pupil size = pupil size − baseline). We discuss the role of baseline correction as a part of preprocessing of pupillometric data, and make five recommendations: (1) before baseline correction, perform data preprocessing to mark missing and invalid data, but assume that some distortions will remain in the data; (2) use subtractive baseline correction; (3) visually compare your corrected and uncorrected data; (4) be wary of pupil-size effects that emerge faster than the latency of the pupillary response allows (within ±220 ms after the manipulation that induces the effect); and (5) remove trials on which baseline pupil size is unrealistically small (indicative of blinks and other distortions).},

	abstract = {Pupillometry has been one of the most widely used response systems in psychophysiology. Changes in pupil size can reflect diverse cognitive and emotional states, ranging from arousal, interest and effort to social decisions, but they are also widely used in clinical practice to assess patients’ brain functioning. As a result, research involving pupil size measurements has been reported in practically all psychology, psychiatry, and psychophysiological research journals, and now it has found its way into the primatology literature as well as into more practical applications, such as using pupil size as a measure of fatigue or a safety index during driving. The different systems used for recording pupil size are almost as variable as its applications, and all yield, as with many measurement techniques, a substantial amount of noise in addition to the real pupillometry data. Before analyzing pupil size, it is therefore of crucial importance first to detect this noise and deal with it appropriately, even prior to (if need be) resampling and baseline-correcting the data. In this article we first provide a short review of the literature on pupil size measurements, then we highlight the most important sources of noise and show how these can be detected. Finally, we provide step-by-step guidelines that will help those interested in pupil size to preprocess their data correctly. These guidelines are accompanied by an open source MATLAB script (available at https://github.com/ElioS-S/pupil-size). Given that pupil diameter is easily measured by standard eyetracking technologies and can provide fundamental insights into cognitive and emotional processes, it is hoped that this article will further motivate scholars from different disciplines to study pupil size.},

Surprisingly, there is little consistency and transparency in preprocessing steps, making replicability and reproducibility difficult. To increase replicability, reproducibility, and transparency, a package in R (a free and widely used statistical programming environment) called gazeR was created to read and preprocess two types of data: gaze position and pupil size. For gaze position data, gazeR has functions for reading in raw eye-tracking data, formatting it for analysis, converting from gaze coordinates to areas of interest, and binning and aggregating data. For data from pupillometry studies, the gazeR package has functions for reading in and merging multiple raw pupil data files, removing observations with too much missing data, eliminating artifacts, blink identification and interpolation, subtractive baseline correction, and binning and aggregating data. The package is open-source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/dmirman/gazer.

Through constructing a Stackelberg game model consisting of a supplier and a capital-constrained manufacturer who is investing in carbon emission reduction, we analyze the optimal decisions and financing selection strategies under different allowance allocation rules. These results show that the manufacturer always invests a higher carbon emission reduction under the benchmarking rule. Meanwhile, he always prefers BCF no matter how the carbon allocation rules change. Whereas, the upstream supplier would like to provide delayed payment under TCF. The government is beneficial to provide the benchmarking rule to the manufacturer when his historical carbon emission is lower, otherwise, the government can implement the grandfathering rule.},

	abstract = {Green credit financing (GCF) is a type of financial service provided by banks to encourage borrowers to commit green investment and achieve sustainable development. This study investigates a supply chain system consisting of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a well-funded supplier facing uncertain demand, in which the manufacturer may seek GCF from banks. An important prerequisite for obtaining a green loan is that the borrower must make green upgrades and ensure compliance with pre-specified environmental standards. We design a GCF model for a supply chain by imposing a hard constraint on carbon emissions. To determine the effectiveness of GCF, we conduct an in-depth analysis comparing the GCF with traditional trade credit financing (TCF), in which excessive carbon emissions are penalized. The optimal equilibrium solutions under GCF and TCF mode are obtained and their sensitivities to key parameters analyzed. Concerning the preferences of the two financing strategies, we find that under a relatively strict carbon emission policy, the manufacturer can set an appropriate green investment range to achieve a win-win situation with the supplier. Finally, we compare the social welfare of the supply chain for the different financing modes and find that there are regions in which both the social welfare and profit of the manufacturer can be a win-win. The government can guide manufacturers to make a win-win choice by setting different carbon caps.},

Three cap-and-trade mechanisms are considered, No cap-and-trade Mechanism (NM), Grandfathering Mechanism (GM), and Benchmarking Mechanism (BM). We find that the utility firm invests more in renewable energy under either a GM or a BM than that under NM. As compared to GM, the utility firm under the BM invests more in renewable energy, while at the same time it generates more carbon emissions. We also show that investment in renewable energy does not necessarily reduce carbon emissions. When the government sets the unit carbon quota appropriately, however, BM can not only achieve a reduction in carbon emissions, but also ensure that electricity demand will not decrease. The implementation of BM can make the utility firm invest most heavily in renewable energy, while the implementation of GM will produce the lowest carbon emissions. When either a GM or a BM implemented under a lenient unit carbon quota (or total carbon quota), the utility firm can be more profitable. The study provides some new management insights for the policy-maker.},

Overall, we estimate about 28 percent of people are multidimensionally poor in 2012 in the region. We find statistically significant reductions of poverty in most countries, both in terms of incidence and intensity over the period under analysis. However, important disparities between rural and urban areas remain.

	abstract = {This paper sets out a systemic account of intertemporal changes in multidimensional poverty using the Alkire–Foster Adjusted Headcount Ratio and its consistent sub-indices. It uses three techniques to assess the pro-poorness of multidimensional poverty reduction. The analysis of changes in multidimensional poverty draws on the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and related destitution measure in 34 countries and 338 sub-national regions, covering 2.5 billion people, for which there is a recent MPI estimation and comparable Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across time. First, it assesses overall changes in poverty and its incidence and intensity, and compares this with changes in \$1.90 poverty. Next, utilizing the property of subgroup decomposability, it examines changes in the MPI and its consistent sub-indices over time across urban–rural regions, sub-national regions and ethnic groups. The decomposition analysis identifies relevant national patterns, including those in which the pace of poverty reduction is higher for the poorest subgroups. Finally, the paper analyzes the dynamics of a strict subset of the poor, who are identified as “destitute” using a more extreme deprivation cutoff vector, and studies relative rates of reduction of destitution and poverty by country and region. This extensive empirical analysis illustrates how to assess the extent and patterns of reduction of multidimensional poverty, as well as whether it is inclusive or whether some people or groups are left behind. Naturally, some further research questions emerge.},

	abstract = {Many authors have insisted on the necessity of defining poverty as a multidimensional concept rather than relying on income or consumption expenditures per capita. Yet, not much has actually been done to include the various dimensions of deprivation into the practical definition and measurement of poverty. Existing attempts along that direction consist of aggregating various attributes into a single index through some arbitrary function and defining a poverty line and associated poverty measures on the basis of that index. This is merely redefining more generally the concept of poverty, which then essentially remains a one dimensional concept. The present paper suggests that an alternative way to take into account the multi-dimensionality of poverty is to specify a poverty line for each dimension of poverty and to consider that a person is poor if he/she falls below at least one of these various lines. The paper then explores how to combine these various poverty lines and associated one-dimensional gaps into multidimensional poverty measures. An application of these measures to the rural population in Brazil is also given with poverty defined on income and education.},

In recent work we have attempted to offer a practical approach to identifying the poor and measuring aggregate poverty (Alkire and Foster, J Public Econ, 2011). As this is quite a departure from traditional unidimensional and multidimensional poverty measurement—particularly with respect to the identification step—further elaboration may be warranted. In this paper we elucidate the strengths, limitations, and misunderstandings of multidimensional poverty measurement in order to clarify the debate and catalyse further research. We begin with general definitions of unidimensional and multidimensional methodologies for measuring poverty. We provide an intuitive description of our measurement approach, including a ‘dual cutoff’ identification step that views poverty as the state of being multiply deprived, and an aggregation step based on the traditional FGT measures. We briefly discuss five characteristics of our methodology that are easily overlooked or mistaken and conclude with some brief remarks on the way forward.},

While financial literacy and schooling attainment are both strongly positively associated with wealth outcomes in linear regression models, our approach reveals even stronger and larger effects of financial literacy on wealth. It also indicates no significant positive effects of schooling attainment conditional on financial literacy in a linear specification, but positive effects when interacted with financial literacy. Estimated impacts are substantial enough to suggest that investments in financial literacy could have large positive payoffs.},

            Chileans have limited knowledge of the pension system, its rules, and the consequences involved in their personal decisions within it. Using a variation in the household composition – having a pensioner in the household – as an instrument, we show that Chileans with greater knowledge about the pension system are more likely to have additional financial savings, but not within the voluntary pension saving plans offered by the pension system. We find that getting one additional answer right in the pension literacy survey (out of six) generates approximately a 50\% additional chance that the individual will save at least in one of the surveyed periods, and a 25\% additional chance that the individual will save in both surveyed periods. We also test for evidence that pension literacy affects worker choices regarding their pension savings (what we call active financial behavior). We find that more literate workers are more likely to engage in pension fund type switching and that independent workers are more likely to voluntarily enter the pension system as affiliates if they have greater pension finance literacy. Getting one additional answer right in the pension literacy survey (out of six) increases the probability of pension fund type switching by 20\% and the probability of voluntary affiliation to the pension system of self-employed workers by 30\%.},

Under these ideal conditions, managers redirect more profits toward public goods than shareholders would when acting separately—shareholders are poorer but happier.

We extend the framework of Nitzan and Fershtman and include a diffusion term. We consider two cases. In the first case, the volatility of the diffusion term is dependent on the current level of the public good. This set-up will in principle lead to the same type of feedback strategies computed under certainty. In the second case, the volatility is dependent on the current rate of public good provision by the agents. The results are qualitatively different. We provide a detailed discussion as well as numerical examples. In particular, we show that in both cases uncertainty signifies the free rider effect.},

Taking advantage of the phase-in period of the reform I find that donors have two different reactions depending on the size of the recipients. On average if the EU stops allocating food aid to a small country, this reduces by 1.4 the average number of other donors. On the contrary, if the EU stops allocating to a large country, this increases by 0.3 the average number of other donors. I also observe differences between EU members and other countries. Next, I develop a simple theoretical framework in which donors react to EU’s action either indirectly because it changes the recipient’s needs or directly because they are motivated by comparing with their allocation with the EU. I derive a donor typology from the theoretical framework. Donors are motivated by direct comparison with the EU allocation in the case of small countries and by recipient’s characteristics for large countries.},

Applied to the case of fundraising, the results show how overall donations and the number of effectively funded projects may both decrease as the total number of projects vying for funding increases. The analysis considers whether making one of the contribution options salient, either through its merits or by arbitrarily choosing one to feature during the experiment, helps overcome the increased coordination problem. The results have implications for the growing popularity of crowdfunding websites, and suggest benefits to these sites from helping donors compare and identify the most promising projects.},

It is their decisions regarding the allocation of donations across uses that matter in the end. Donors to these firms take into account the allocation decisions that will be made by the organizations to which they contribute. We find a propensity for such organizations to specialize in the provision of services, and further find that diversification by such firms diminishes the equilibrium level of contributions they will collect. We demonstrate the possibility that a commitment by a monopoly charity to an allocation rule that is, ex-post, privately sub-optimal can eliminate this effect, and may therefore be advantageous, ex-ante. The allocation rule which accomplishes this involves honouring donor designations of their contributions to specific uses.

	abstract = {Why are many large non-governmental organizations (NGOs) becoming multinational entities? What are the welfare implications of this integration of markets for development donations? To answer these questions, we build a simple two-country model with horizontally differentiated NGOs competing in fundraising. We find that NGOs become multinational if the economies of scale in fundraising are sufficiently large. In that case, national NGOs in the smaller country disappear, while some national NGOs remain in the larger country only if country sizes are sufficiently different. Social welfare is higher in the regime with multinationals than under autarky.},

In this paper, we introduce the concept of competitive equilibrium for a warm-glow economy (henceforth, warm-glow equilibrium) and establish both existence and welfare properties. The warm-glow equilibrium concept may prove to be very useful to the normative and positive theory of public goods provision. First, it is a price-based mechanism achieving efficient outcomes. Second, not only could the warm-glow equilibria outcomes serve as a point of reference to measure free-riding and welfare loss but also, as suggested by Bernheim and Rangel (Behavioral Economics and Its Applications, 2007), in large economies they may be approximated by Walrasian equilibria outcomes.},

Across 4 studies, lower class individuals proved to be more generous (Study 1), charitable (Study 2), trusting (Study 3), and helpful (Study 4) compared with their upper class counterparts. Mediator and moderator data showed that lower class individuals acted in a more prosocial fashion because of a greater commitment to egalitarian values and feelings of compassion.

Evolution has often confronted such dilemmas—e.g., in bacterial biofilms—in the challenges of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups; there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions that maintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon,” and hence in how groups of individuals form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.},

Although several examples of allocation-taxation schemes falling within the general model are discussed, the major contribution of the paper is the formulation of a particular government allocation-taxation scheme for which the behavioral equilibria are Pareto optimal. That is, given the government rules, consumers find it in their self-interest to reveal their true preferences for public goods.},

An impact philanthropist is someone who wants to personally ‘make a difference.’ While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist’s charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor’s contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

Those methods can provide a solution to the widespread research problem that quantitative data on the activities of NPOs are needed but not readily available from administrative data, long high-quality texts describing NPOs’ activities are mostly unavailable, and human labor resources are limited. We find that in such a setting, rule-based classification performs about as well as manual human coding in terms of precision and sensitivity, while being much more labor-saving. Hence, we share our insights on how to efficiently implement such a rule-based approach. To address scholars with a background in data analytics as well as those without, we provide non-technical explanations and open-source sample code that is free to use and adapt.},

In this paper we summarize some of the recent empirical evidence that has generalized the principle of relatedness to a fact describing the entry and exit of products, industries, occupations, and technologies, at the national, regional, and metropolitan scales.

The authors of The Atlas of Economic Complexity offer readers an explanation based on "Economic Complexity," a measure of a society's productive knowledge. Prosperous societies are those that have the knowledge to make a larger variety of more complex products. The Atlas of Economic Complexity attempts to measure the amount of productive knowledge countries hold and how they can move to accumulate more of it by making more complex products.Through the graphical representation of the "Product Space," the authors are able to identify each country's "adjacent possible," or potential new products, making it easier to find paths to economic diversification and growth. In addition, they argue that a country's economic complexity and its position in the product space are better predictors of economic growth than many other well-known development indicators, including measures of competitiveness, governance, finance, and schooling.Using innovative visualizations, the book locates each country in the product space, provides complexity and growth potential rankings for 128 countries, and offers individual country pages with detailed information about a country's current capabilities and its diversification options. The maps and visualizations included in the Atlas can be used to find more viable paths to greater productive knowledge and prosperity.},

The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or “product space,” finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.
Network analysis of the products made by rich and poor countries show that movement toward higher-profit products may be restricted for much of the developing world.

	abstract = {When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the “social responsibilities of business in a free-enterprise system”, I am reminded of the wonderful line about the Frenchman who discovered at the age of 70 that he had been speaking prose all his life. The businessmen believe that they are defending free enterprise when they declaim that business is not concerned “merely” with profit but also with promoting desirable “social” ends; that business has a “social conscience” and takes seriously its responsibilities for providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers. In fact they are — or would be if they or anyone else took them seriously -preaching pure and unadulterated socialism. Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades.},

	abstract = {This text by one of Europe's leading economists covers a wide variety of public economics issues with great clarity and precision, illustrating them with a wealth of carefully-chosen examples and problems.Starting from theories of general equilibrium analysis, Laffont considers issues of market failure, collective decisionmaking, and distributional equity. He analyzes the important informational and motivational problems involved in planning solutions for market failures, and provides a rigorous justification for the theoretical foundations of public economics.Topics include the theories of externalities, public goods, collective choice, consumer surplus, cost-benefit analysis and/or theory of the second best, incomplete markets, and nonconvexities. For each Laffont begins with the classical foundations, moves on to consider the topic within a simple model of the economy, and concludes by integrating results from recent journal articles into this simple framework. In this way students are led to understand the classical tradition in the context of modern general equilibrium theory.The book concludes with eight problems with solutions, each interesting and rich enough to be considered a case study, and nine exercises without solutions; together they provide an excellent review of material covered in the text. The basic approach in each problem is to set up a general equilibrium model, discover the market failure by calculating the unfettered equilibrium, and develop an explicit planning solution.Jean-Jacques Laffont is Professor of Economics at the University of Social Sciences at Toulouse. Fundamentals of Economics may be used in either an advanced graduate-level course in public economics or in conjunction with a second volume forthcoming by the same author in a course in advanced microeconomics.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of corporate sustainability on organizational processes and performance. Using a matched sample of 180 U.S. companies, we find that corporations that voluntarily adopted sustainability policies by 1993—termed as high sustainability companies—exhibit by 2009 distinct organizational processes compared to a matched sample of companies that adopted almost none of these policies—termed as low sustainability companies. The boards of directors of high sustainability companies are more likely to be formally responsible for sustainability, and top executive compensation incentives are more likely to be a function of sustainability metrics. High sustainability companies are more likely to have established processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial information. Finally, high sustainability companies significantly outperform their counterparts over the long term, both in terms of stock market and accounting performance.This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy.},

	abstract = {Eco-effectiveness and cradle-to-cradle design present an alternative design and production concept to the strategies of zero emission and eco-3efficiency. Where eco-efficiency and zero emission seek to reduce the unintended negative consequences of processes of production and consumption, eco-effectiveness is a positive agenda for the conception and production of goods and services that incorporate social, economic, and environmental benefit, enabling triple top line growth. Eco-effectiveness moves beyond zero emission approaches by focusing on the development of products and industrial systems that maintain or enhance the quality and productivity of materials through subsequent life cycles. The concept of eco-effectiveness also addresses the major shortcomings of eco-efficiency approaches: their inability to address the necessity for fundamental redesign of material flows, their inherent antagonism towards long-term economic growth and innovation, and their insufficiency in addressing toxicity issues. A central component of the eco-effectiveness concept, cradle-to-cradle design provides a practical design framework for creating products and industrial systems in a positive relationship with ecological health and abundance, and long-term economic growth. Against this background, the transition to eco-effective industrial systems is a five-step process beginning with an elimination of undesirable substances and ultimately calling for a reinvention of products by reconsidering how they may optimally fulfill the need or needs for which they are actually intended while simultaneously being supportive of ecological and social systems. This process necessitates the creation of an eco-effective system of `' nutrient `' management to coordinate the material flows amongst actors in the product system. The concept of intelligent materials pooling illustrates how such a system might take shape, in reality. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {There have long been calls from industry for guidance in implementing strategies for sustainable development. The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th `Five Year Plan'), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences. This leads us to propose a revised definition of the Circular Economy as “an economic model wherein planning, resourcing, procurement, production and reprocessing are designed and managed, as both process and output, to maximize ecosystem functioning and human well-being”.},

	abstract = {Given the complexity of circular economy implementation, the literature is missing a strategic stand-point. This paper investigates the taxonomy of circular economy implementation strategies at the managerial level by linking it to strategy literature. The taxonomy was developed by using standard k-mean clustering method that incorporates 391 Cradle-to-Cradle product scorecards of 187 companies from 10 different industries. The analysis was based on the relative importance assigned to each competitive capability that defines the circular economy; namely, material health, material reutilization, renewable energy, water stewardship, and social fairness. Three distinct clusters of circular economy implementation strategy groups were observed: (i) founding (recyclers), (ii) development (all-decent circulars), and (iii) maturity (toxicity fighters). All clusters have been present in various industries, although there is an industry effect. The results indicate that each cluster has a different strategy. The results obtained contradict the general assumption and expectation of simultaneous improvement at all circular economy dimensions. Our research contributes to the theoretical understanding of circular economy implementation by providing a taxonomy of strategies. It contributes to the strategy literature by suggesting that the maturity degree of a competitive capability may determine the implementation strategy. For practice, the study presents a road-map for managers to reach higher degrees of circularity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the many paradoxes of fashions is that consumers’ choices change rapidly and with an astonishing degree of synchronization. What is successful or socially acceptable in one period is considered the opposite in the next. This paradox has brought economists and other social scientists to conceive of fashions and fads as one of many forms of irrational behavior. Herd behavior and weakness of will, a desire to conform or, conversely, to distinguish oneself, have all been invoked to explain the rapid evolution of modes of behavior that emerge and more or less suddenly disappear. In this paper we try to show that fashions, even if fragile and transient, might nonetheless be rational. It is a rationality, however, that has to include something overlooked in most economic writing: the desire for novelty and variety. In fashions this desire takes the form of coordinated behavior that both facilitates consumption and destroys its novel content, thus paving the way for new fashions to appear.},

function will often violate monotonicity, in case consumption hurts
cherished values in a way that isnít o§set by the hedonic beneÖts of
material consumption. We distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental values, and argue that the former tend to introduce discontinuities near zero. For example, a vegetarianís preferences would be
discontinuous near zero amount of animal meat. We axiomatize a
utility representation that captures such preferences and discuss the
measurability of the degree to which consumers care about such values.},

En particular, se busca identificar si más años de educación tienen un efecto causal sobre el nivel de salud, enfrentando el problema de que la educación es endógena en esta relación. Se utiliza una estrategia de variables instrumentales a través de la reforma educacional de 1981 que aumenta la oferta de educación de manera exógena. Los resultados muestran que habría evidencia de un efecto causal positivo de la educación sobre la salud, disminuyendo la probabilidad de estar enfermo en 8\% (en los resultados que son significativos) y la de tener alguna discapacidad en 5 \%. Este efecto sería generado a través de mayor cuidado de la salud de los más educados, que aumentan en 15\% la probabilidad de hacerse controles médicos.},

	abstract = {WHO places Chile among countries with greater morbidity burden for psychiatric diseases in the world (23,2\%). Major depression and alcohol consumption disorders hold the first and second place in disabilities attributed to adults. Almost a third of the population older than 15 years have suffered a psychiatric disorder during life span and 22,2\% persons have had one in the last year. Anxiety disorders have more prevalence, followed by major depression and alcohol consumption disorders. Only 38,5\% of those diagnosed receive some type of mental health care, by an specialist or a primary health care physician. In children and adolescent, prevalence of any psychiatric disorder is 22,5\% (19,3\% for boys and 25,8\% for girls). These disorders are mainly disruptive and of anxiety. Prevalence is higher for children between 4 to 11 years (27,8\%) than between 12 and 18 years, and this difference is due mainly to disruptive disorders. Prevalence of anxiety disorders is the second highest, even though less associated with disabilities, while many children and adolescents with affective disorders are disabled and only a fifth of persons with health care needs look for some form of care. Almost a fourth of those that use health care services did not present psychiatric diagnosis during last year. Co morbidity occurs in 27\% of those with disorders, but only 7\% have three or more diagnosis. Not addressing treatment gap in mental health has serious implications in public health.},

	abstract = {The spectre of the repugnant conclusion and the search for a population axiology that avoids it has endured as a focus of population ethics. This is in part because the repugnant conclusion is often interpreted as a defining problem for totalism, while the implications of averagism and related views are taken to illustrate the theoretical cost of avoiding the repugnant conclusion. However, we show that this interpretation cannot be sustained unless one focuses only on a special case of the repugnant conclusion: namely, the subset of instances of the repugnant conclusion where there is no portion of the population unaffected by the choice between population outcomes (as in Derek Parfit’s original illustration). To avoid an inappropriate focus on only this proper subset of instances of the repugnant conclusion, we formulate a general characterization of the repugnant conclusion. We then prove formally that all leading welfarist axiologies imply this conclusion, including averagism and Ng’s Theory X′ , including probabilistic and ‘very repugnant’ variants that involve the addition of negative lives. We then prove that the full range of axiologies considered by population ethics each imply an extended version of the repugnant conclusion, including axiologies that are incomplete, intransitive, rank-dependent, person-affecting, and/or pluralist. The upshot is that the repugnant conclusion does not ultimately tell against any approach to axiology, and the methodological requirement to avoid the repugnant conclusion should be dropped from population axiology. *Harvard University, Princeton University CFI, and University of Vermont. †University of Texas at Austin, Princeton University CFI, Indian Statistical Institute-Delhi Centre, IZA Institute of Labor Economics, and Institute for Future Studies, Stockholm. corresponding author: dspears@utexas.edu.

The contribution of the productivity to the sectorial growth is estimated residually, based on a Cobb-Douglas production function for the sectorial GDP and independent measures for capital and labor, corrected by quality and intensity of use. As a result, the sectorial TFP has exhibited a downward trend in the last five years, after remaining virtually flat since 1986 to 2011. The economic growth of the sector shows to be dominated by the accumulation of factors rather than by the efficiency with which they are used in the productive process. This could explain, partially, the vulnerability of sectorial activity to the economic cycle.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a decomposition of economic growth in Chile, based on the contribution of capital, labor, and total factor productivity (TFP) and to study the determinants of TFP behavior in Chile since 1960 to date. Our results indicate that the contribution of TFP to growth differs significantly from one period to another. During 1961-1973 the contribution of capital dominates, labor takes over in 1974-1989, and TFP in 1990-2003. Evidence on TFP determinants suggests that, besides cyclical factors, TFP growth reflects the impact of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. The interaction of both factors in TFP behavior is worth noting. Evidence suggests also that, under conditions of high macroeconomic instability, the effects of a structural reform on TFP are smaller, and vice versa. An analogous situation can be expected from macroeconomic stabilization efforts.},

First, it describes the economy’s structure in terms of the sectors’ relative sizes in the long term and the importance of the various components of aggregate demand. Second, it documents the main features of business cycles in Chile. The volatility and persistence of several variables across the cycles is described, together with the correlations within a set of significant variables. In general, the correlations observed tend to indicate that supply-side factors play an important role in explaining business cycles in Chile. On the aggregate demand side, terms of trade and availability of foreign capital are found to have substantial effects on all its different components.},
